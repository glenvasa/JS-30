      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // new assignments of age/name do not change
      // value of age2/name2

      //   let age = 100;
      //   let age2 = age;
      //   console.log(age, age2);
      //   age = 200;
      //   console.log(age, age2);

      //   let name = "Glen";
      //   let name2 = name;
      //   console.log(name, name2);
      //   name = "Glenny";
      //   console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      //   const team = players;
      //   console.log(players, team);

      // this changes 4th item in team AND players arrays
      // because 'team' is a reference to the 'players' array

      //   team[3] = "Lux";
      //   console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      //   const team2 = players.slice();
      //   console.log(players, team2);

      //   team2[3] = "Lux";
      //   console.log(players, team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      //   const team2 = [].concat(players);
      //   console.log(team2);

      //   team2[3] = "Lux";
      //   console.log(players, team2);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      //   const team2 = [...players];
      //   console.log(players, team2);

      //   team2[3] = "Lux";
      //   console.log(players, team2);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // Also,

      //   const team2 = Array.from(players);
      //   team2[3] = "Lux";

      //   console.log(players, team2);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      //   const captain = person;
      //   captain.age = 99;
      //   console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      //   const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
      //   console.log(person, captain);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      //   const captain = { ...person };
      //   captain.age = 99;
      //   console.log(captain, person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      //   console.log(wes);

      //   const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

      //   dev.name = "Wesley";
      //   console.log(wes, dev);

      // this changes twitter value for both objects even though
      // dev is a copy of wes, because it becomes a reference when
      // 2+ levels deep.
      // you need a clone deep function to clone all levels

      //   dev.social.twitter = "@wesleybos";
      //   console.log(wes, dev);

      //   this also works

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      console.log(wes.social, dev2.social);

      dev2.social.twitter = "@coolman";
      console.log(wes.social, dev2.social);
